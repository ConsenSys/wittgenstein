## Why this name?
Wittgenstein was a concert pianist. He commissioned Ravel's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, but changed it:
 'lines taken from the orchestral part and added to the solo, harmonies changed, parts added, bars cut and
  at the end a newly created series of great swirling arpeggios in the final cadenza.'

As it's often what happens with mock protocol implementations, it looked like the right name.
